# Failure Gallery — CareerCompiler

An honest record of things that broke, why, and what changed. A curated gallery beats a buried
changelog: it is where the doctrine earns its keep. Every entry names the *reported* symptom and
the *diagnosed* root cause separately (Standard 5).

> The entry below is a seeded template. Replace it with the first real failure you diagnose.

## FAIL-0001 (template) — Demo showed no data

- **Date**: 2026-07-21
- **Surface**: `GET /api/v1/demo`
- **Reported symptom**: The demo view rendered "no data".
- **Diagnosed cause**: `data/synthetic/demo.json` existed but was an empty array. The endpoint
  correctly raised HTTP 500 (`"synthetic fixture is empty"`) instead of silently returning `[]`.
- **Root cause**: Fixture authored empty during scaffold.
- **Fix**: Populated the fixture with a non-empty synthetic dataset. The smoke test asserts
  `items` is non-empty, so this cannot regress silently.
- **Doctrine link**: Standard 3 (no silent mock/fallback) and Standard 2 (smoke asserts non-empty).
